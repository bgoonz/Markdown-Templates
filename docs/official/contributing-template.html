    <p>
      We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other
      contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and
      contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our
      <a

      Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A
      few general guidelines that cover both:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To report security vulnerabilities, please use our
        <a href="https://auth0.com/whitehat">Responsible Disclosure Program</a>
        which is monitored by our security team.
      </li>
      <li>Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.</li>
      <li>
        We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but,
        depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root
        cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a
        contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’ve never contributed before, see

          >the first timer’s guide on our blog</a
        >
        for resources and tips on how to get started.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new
      feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you
      create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through
      collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you’re having, please add
      your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than
      creating a new one. Adding a
      <a
        href="https://github.com/bgoonz/Music-Theory-n-Web-Synth-Keyboard/issues"
        >reaction</a
      >
      can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem
      is affecting more than just the reporter.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests</h3>
    <p>
      PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your
      fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Only fix/add the functionality in question <strong>OR</strong> address
        wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a
        test suite already exists).
      </li>
      <li>
        Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as
        possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Include documentation in the repo or on our
        <a href="https://auth0.com/docs">docs site</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically
        when a PR is created).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking
      changes (e.g. a major release), it’s best to open an Issue to discuss your
      proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and
      reviewing changes.
    </p>
    <p>

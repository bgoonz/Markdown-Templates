/**
 * Creates a function that memoizes the result of `fn`. If `resolver` is
 * provided it determines the cache key for storing the result based on the
 * arguments provided to the memoized function. By default, the first argument
 * provided to the memoized function is coerced to a string and used as the
 * cache key. The `fn` is invoked with the `this` binding of the memoized
 * function. Modified from lodash.
 *
 * @param {Function} fn Function to have its output memoized.
 * @param {Function} context Function to resolve the cache key.
 * @return {Function} Returns the new memoized function.
